# Logical Crafting

Custom crafting recipes for Minecraft 1.13 that I wish were in the default game:

## Renewable Coral Blocks

1.13 adds the new coral blocks but they can't be crafted. We should be protecting our coral reefs not destroying them!
You can grow coral using bone meal and with these recipes you can now craft coral blocks and keep your coral reefs
untouched.

Use 9 coral to create a coral block:

Use 9 dead coral to create a dead coral block:

## Consistent Wool Dyeing

Many blocks that can be dyed use 8 plain blocks and one dye which results in 8 dyed blocks. Wool is an exception to this
and so these recipes make wool dyeing more consistent. The original recipes remain just in case you need to dye that one
wool block.

## How to install

1. Download the [datapack zip file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logicalgeekboy/logical-crafting/master/dist/logical-crafting.zip)
2. On the world selection screen, select your world and click "Edit".
3. Click "Open World Folder".
4. Place the datapack zip file in the `datapacks` folder.
5. Start your world. If it doesn't work, using the command `/reload`.

## Building

To build the data pack, run the following that will update the `.zip` file in the `dist` folder. This file can then be
dropped into a worlds `datapacks` folder:

```
$ ./build.sh
```
